# Grok

Grok is AMARO development knowledge base.

## What is Grok?

[Grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) is a word coined by [Robert A. Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein) for his 1961 science-fiction novel [Stranger in a Strange Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land). While the [Oxford English Dictionary (OED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary) summarizes the meaning of _grok_ as "to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with" and "to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with)"; also, "to experience enjoyment".

In other words it can be described as "understand something so thoroughly that you merge with it and it merges with you".

## Adoption in the programming culture

The [Jargon File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File), which describes itself as a "Hacker's Dictionary" and has been published under that name three times, puts _grok_ in a programming context:

> When you claim to "grok" some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has become part of you, part of your identity. For example, to say that you "know" Lisp is simply to assert that you can code in it if necessary â€” but to say you "grok" LISP is to claim that you have deeply entered the world-view and spirit of the language, with the implication that it has transformed your view of programming. Contrast zen, which is a similar supernatural understanding experienced as a single brief flash.

To deeply understand something is hard, takes effort and time, so it's rare but it's also rewarding. Our objective is not _grok_ everything, but _grok_ some stuff we care in technology, entrepeneurship, agile, startup and fashion.
